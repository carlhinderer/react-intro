CHAPTER 1 - FIRST REACT APPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Node 

    - Node was created in 2009 as an application runtime for server-side applications 
        written in JavaScript.  It's based on the JS engine used in the Chrome browser.

      While it has had success as an application server, it has also provided the foundation of
        a new generation of development and build tools.

        # Get Node Version
        $ node -v

        # Get npm Version
        $ npm -v



- The create-react-app Package

    - The create-react-app package is the standard way to create and manage complex React
        packages.  It provides a complete development toolchain.

        # Install create-react-app
        $ npm install --global create-react-app@2.1.2



- The react-devtools Browser Extension

    - The react-devtools browser extension, available in Firefox and Chrome, is very useful,
        especially when working on complex projects.



- Creating the Project

    - The 'npx' command is installed as part of node.  It is used to round out the experience
        of using packages from the npm registry.

        # Create new react app
        $ npx create-react-app todo
