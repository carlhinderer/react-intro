CHAPTER 1 - FIRST REACT APPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Node 

    - Node was created in 2009 as an application runtime for server-side applications 
        written in JavaScript.  It's based on the JS engine used in the Chrome browser.

      While it has had success as an application server, it has also provided the foundation of
        a new generation of development and build tools.

        # Get Node Version
        $ node -v

        # Get npm Version
        $ npm -v



- The create-react-app Package

    - The create-react-app package is the standard way to create and manage complex React
        packages.  It provides a complete development toolchain.

        # Install create-react-app
        $ npm install --global create-react-app@2.1.2



- The react-devtools Browser Extension

    - The react-devtools browser extension, available in Firefox and Chrome, is very useful,
        especially when working on complex projects.



- Creating the Project

    - The 'npx' command is installed as part of node.  It is used to round out the experience
        of using packages from the npm registry.

        # Create new react app
        $ npx create-react-app todo


    - The directory structure of the new application looks like:

        > todo
            > node_modules
            > public
                favicon.ico
                index.html
                manifest.json
            > src
                App.css
                App.js
                App.test.js
                index.css
                index.js
                logo.svg
                registerServiceWorker.js
            .gitignore
            package.json
            package-lock.json
            README.md


    - Important files include:

        public/index.html
          This is the html file loaded by the browser.  It contains an element in which the 
            application is displayed and a script element that holds the JS files.

        src/index.js
          This is the JS file responsible for configuring and starting the React application.
            We used it to add the Bootstrap CSS framework.

        src/App.js
          This is the React component, which contains the HTML content that will be displayed
            to the user and the JS code required by the HTML.  Components are the building
            blocks of React applications.



- Adding the Bootstrap Framework

    # Add bootstrap to project
    $ cd todo
    $ npm install bootstrap@4.1.2
