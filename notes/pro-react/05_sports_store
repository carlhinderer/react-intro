CHAPTER 5 - SPORTS STORE - A REAL APPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Starting the Project

    - Our application, SportsStore, will have an online product catalog, shopping cart,
        checkout, and admin page.

        # Create the application
        $ npx create-react-app sportsstore



- Required Packages

    - We need to install additional packages for this project.

        # Install additional packages
        cd sportsstore
        npm install bootstrap@4.1.2
        npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.6.1
        npm install redux@4.0.1
        npm install react-redux@6.0.0
        npm install react-router-dom@4.3.1
        npm install axios@0.18.0
        npm install graphql@14.0.2
        npm install apollo-boost@0.1.22
        npm install react-apollo@2.3.2


    - Here is what those packages do:

        bootstrap
          This package provides the CSS styles that I used to present HTML content 
            throughout the book.

        fontawesome-free
          This package provides icons that can be included in HTML content. I have used the 
            free package, but there is a more comprehensive paid-for option available, too.

        redux
          This package provides a data store, which simplifies the process of coordinating the 
            different parts of the application.

        react-redux
          This package integrates a Redux data store into a React application.

        react-router-dom
          This package provides URL routing, which allows the content presented to the user to 
            be selected based on the browserâ€™s current URL.

        axios
          This package is used to make HTTP requests and will be used to access RESTful and 
            GraphQL services.

        graphql
          This package contains the reference implementation of the GraphQL specification.

        apollo-boost
          This package contains a client used to consume a GraphQL service.

        react-apollo
          This package is used to integrate the GraphQL client into a React application.
