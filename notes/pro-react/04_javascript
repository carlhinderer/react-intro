CHAPTER 4 - JAVASCRIPT
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Creating Project

    - JavaScript has been modernized in recent years with the addition of new language
        features and utility functions.  

      Since not all browsers support the latest features, React includes the Babel package,
        which will translate these features into code that will work in most mainstream
        browsers.


    - We'll keep using the 'primer' project from Chapter 3.  First, we'll create a new file
        for testing things out.

        # File: src/example.js
        console.log("Hello");


    - And, we'll need to add our new file to incorporate it into the application.

        # Add to src/index.js after other imports
        import "./example";


    - Start the application.

        $ npm start

      Now, open the Developer Tools in your web browser, and should see the 'Hello' printed.



- Using Statements

    - Statement-terminating semicolons are optional, but adding them makes code more readable
        and allows multiple statements on a single line.



- Defining and Using Functions

    - To define a function:

        const myFunc = function () {
            console.log('Inside the function.');
        }

        myFunc();


    - Define a function without explicitly defining a variable.

        function myFunc() {
            console.log('Inside the function');
        }

        myFunc();
